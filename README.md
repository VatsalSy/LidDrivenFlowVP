# LidDrivenFlowVP

This repository contains the implementation of Viscoplastic viscosity in Basilisk C.

Vola et al. (2003) used the Augmented Lagrangian Method to simulate lid-driven cavity flow. The method has been applied in Basilisk C (http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/popinet/lid-bingham.c)

Here, I implement the regularization method of implementing Viscoplastic fluid.
